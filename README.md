# Timesheet Analysis

**An R shiny app for bookkeeping**


---

## [Motivation](#motivation)

My wife owns a bookkeeping business. She keeps a daily timesheet of her activities for each client, provides external reports for her clients, and creates her own internal reports. While there are paid tools to do some of this work, I thought it'd be fun to automate some of her work with her specific needs in mind.

In theory, this app can be adapted by anyone who keeps a timesheet and wants to see some reporting on it. In practice, a lot of legwork might be needed unless you're a bookkeeper with similar client breakdown and reporting needs.

Some of the nitty gritty of a bookkeeper's clients are: some prefer to pay a fixed rate, others by the hour. Some require minimal work for 2 months out of a quarter so it makes sense to bill them on a quarterly basis, others are on a monthly basis. This app helps with various reporting needs but also with some analysis ones, such as figuring out when to move a client from a a billing type ("hourly", "fixed rate") or term ("monthly", "quarterly") to another one.

The app isn't 100% intuitive for the uninitiated. Some reports are not meant to be chosen with a large period in mind, i.e. the "Daily Hours by Client" expects at most a month (and even that's pushing it). Others expect a full year, such as the "Quarterly Hours" or "Annual Report".
