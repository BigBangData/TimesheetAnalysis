## [Motivation](#motivation)

My wife owns a bookkeeping üìö business and we found some ways for me to help her automate and analyze üìà things.

I've been learning [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) with projects such as [this](https://bigbangdata.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/) and thought it'd be a good tool for her since downloading and running R is more user-friendly to non-programmers than the whole Python üêçüêçüêç ecosystem and running a local app is better for security üîêand privacy.

In `v1` of this project we used Excel as input-output to an R script. In `v2` we used Excel as input and a local shiny app as output. This public-facing `v3` of the project recreates the shiny app with fake data...

<p align="center"><img src="www/munchfakedata.jpg" width=200></p>


...in a reproducible and more realistic way than using a service like [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/), using R and probabilities derived from actual data. This method still has some imperfections: see [faking data](#faking-data) for limitations.


In theoryüéìthis app can be adapted by anyone who keeps a timesheet of any sort (hobbies, projects, exercise) and wants to see some reporting on it. In practice üëäa lot of reworking might be needed unless one's a bookkeeper with similar client breakdown and reporting needs.

See [using the app](#using-the-app) for how to use the app. [Try the app](#try-the-app) or see [reproduce the app](#reproduce-the-app) to run a local version. üíª

## [Try the app](#try-the-app)

Please give [this free service](https://bigbangdata.shinyapps.io/timesheetanalysis/) a few seconds ‚è≥ to get up and... walking <img src="www/ministry-of-silly-walks.gif" width=40>

The app isn't super intuitive for the uninitiated... üõê

"Initiate" by selecting an appropriate time period üìÖ before selecting a report:

- `Sessions:` shorter periods for data; longer ones for plots
- `Daily Hours:` from a week to a quarter
- `Daily Hours by Client:` from a week to a month
- `Monthly Hours`: a quarter or full year
- `Quarterly Hours`: full year
- `Monthly Clients`: must select a specific month
- `Quarterly Clients`: must select a specific quarter
- `Month Report`: a quarter or full year
- `Quarter Report`: full year
- `Annual Report:` full year

## [Using the app](#using-the-app)

### [Overview](#overview)

The app has two main tabs:
1. __Plots__ visualizes the data selected through various menu options
2. __Data & Downloads__ shows the data and a menu of download options


__Plots__

There are 10 reports, see [details](#details) below for specific usage.

<p align="center"><img src="www/01_plots_reports.png" width=550></p>

The `Year`, `Quarter`, and `Month` menus affect the `Start Date` and `End Date` date pickers and interact independently of each other. One must trigger an event by selecting a *different* value in one of these menus (re-selecting the same value won't affect the date pickers).

<p align="center"><img src="www/02_plots_dates.png" width=500></p>

`Term` is the billing cycle: clients pay once a month or once a quarter. The "biz" option is to log unpaid activities related to the bookkeeper's business, such as learning a new niche or tool.

<p align="center"><img src="www/03_plots_term.jpg" width=200></p>

`Client Group` affects the `Client Code` and helps pick specific groups such as deselecting all to pick a particular client, or picking those with a billing `Type`.

There are two types:
- __flat rate__ -fixed rate paid at the start of a term
- __hourly__ - variable rate paid at the end of a term, based on hours worked

<p align="center"><img src="www/04_plots_clients.jpg" width=200></p>

Again, "biz" is treated as a "client" of sorts. All other codes identify actual paying clients. In this project I faked the codes with some Nasdaq symbols of a few companies you might have heard about in the (fake?) news.



```
```

__Data & Downloads tab__

In this tab one can view and download the data and plot selected in the `Plots` tab.

<p align="center"><img src="www/05_data_menu.png" width=550></p>


The data downloads as CSV and the plots as PNG with a few customizations possible, which might come in handy depending on the plot. In particular, the "Daily Hours by Client" report will only work well on the screen for a period of about two weeks, but if a month is desired one can download a long PNG using 16" height by 10" width (see [demo](#demo)).

```
```
### [Details](#details)

__1. Sessions__


Session data is unaggregated data at the level of a work session. It combines two Excel tabs (in our fake data case, two CSV files): __Clients__ and __Timesheet__.

__Clients__ is a more static, small table at the client-level:
- `code` - client code, the primary key (unique per client)
- `term` - monthly, quarterly (or biz as proxy for none)
- `type` - flat rate, hourly (or biz as proxy for none)
- `rate` - the actual payment, in dollars

As an example, if a client is quarterly and hourly (a bad choice!), the bookkeeper will be paid at the end of the quarter for all the hours worked in that quarter, given the hourly rate.

__Timesheeet__ is a more dymanic, long dataset at the session-level, containing the bookeeper's manual timesheet entries:

- `date` - the date
- `clock_in` - the start time of a work session
- `clock_out` - the end time of a work session
- `code` - the client code
- `notes` - notes related to that session
- `tags` - any tags for easier categorization of tasks


There is a variety of plots that could be made with data at this level, but the most useful we found was a boxplot comparison with a `geom_jitter` layer of dots to show not just the distribution of hours worked but also the volume of sessions for each client, given a period.


__2. Daily Hours__

The simplest aggregation simply calculates total hours worked each day and an average hours worked (in work days) for the period selected. The barplot-timeseries was a bit tricky as I wanted to capture non workdays as well. This helps with the bookkeeper's overall tracking of their hours, not specific reporting of client hours.

__3. Daily Hours by Client__


This is the solution for specific client hours and a comparison of monthly vs quarterly clients and one's own business hours. It is a panel grid where each panel is a working day. If more than 8 working days are chosen it splits into two columns of panels. This is the plot that can get overloaded with days on screen but can be downloaded in tall format if an entire month is desired.


__4. Monthly Hours__

A simple rollup of the "Daily Hours" report - it's NOT for only monthly clients, it's for all clients (including "biz").

__5. Quarterly Hours__

A simple rollup of the "Daily Hours" report - it's NOT for only quarterly clients, it's for all clients (including "biz").

__6. Monthly Clients__

This report (and the next) help the bookkeeper assess the trade-offs of keeping a client around with high volume of work for less pay per hour vs focusing on clients with a higher pay rate but less work (so less revenue).

The report is specific to monthly clients (üïµÔ∏è the name) and as such requires the user to first select a single month. It is a scatterplot of revenue by average (mean) hourly rate per client, color-coded by "hours worked" which is factored (bucketed) using quantiles.... this merits a visual:

<p align=center><img src="www/06_monthly_clients.png" width=600></p>

We see that for Dec. 2022, my fake bookkeeper got the most revenue working on Nvidia's books, but that's partly because they went over the 75% quantile (5.2hs, given the period/clients) and so the mean hourly rate`*` is just slightly above average ($109.4). 

On the flipside, the best rate-per-hour that month (for monthly clients) was achieved working on Johnson & Johnson's books, but the workload was a bit light so the revenue is below the average ($411.98).


`*` which is __100% correlated__ üòÖ with hours worked and the rate so we can expect to see a cone of blue clients emanating from the origin of the graph and red clients in the top-left and green clients in the bottom-right.


__7. Quarterly Clients__

Same as "Monthly Clients", for quarterly clients.

<p align="center"><img src="www/obama_mic_drop.gif" width=300></p>


__8. Month Report__

Revenue and mean hourly rates for monthly clients.

<p align=center><img src="www/07_month_report.png" width=600></p>

__9. Quarter Report__

Revenue and mean hourly rates for quarterly clients.

__10. Annual Report__

This report almost works better in the data tab, as a multi-grain breakdown of monthly and quarterly clients with annual rollups and an annual rollup of revenue and mean hourly rate. 

<p align=center><img src="www/08_annual_report_data.png" width=600></p>

The plots tab shows something that can't be easily gleaned in the data tab, which is the relative comparison for each dimension (avg. hourly rate, hours worked, revenue) and client term in each quarter. To ease the visual overload of bars I created a grid of quarters-by-quarters.

<p align=center><img src="www/09_annual_report_plot.png" width=600></p>
